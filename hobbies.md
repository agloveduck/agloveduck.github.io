<br>I really enjoy cooking. I can cook a lot of Chinese food, some Western food, and baking. I can also cook when I go out with friends. But what I usually make is Fried Rice with eggs eaten by myself.



## Traditional Culture

<br>I am fascinated by traditional Chinese culture. Especially history and culture related to history. This is a set of photos taken by me wearing Hanfu in the Forbidden City. To be precise, I am wearing clothes from the Ming Dynasty. You can see the distinctive Mamianqun.


## Handwork

I like to do handicrafts, although my level is just that.
